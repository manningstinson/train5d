## Inspiration

The design of Train5D was inspired by sign-in pages from various cloud-based websites. I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly interface by incorporating:

- **Minimalistic Design**: Focused on simplicity to provide a clutter-free experience.
- **Effective Use of Carousels**: Engaging and interactive carousels for showcasing features.
- **Integration with Third-Party APIs**: Ensuring a smooth login experience with services like Google Login.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring accessibility and functionality across different devices and screen sizes.

These elements were chosen to enhance usability and provide a modern, appealing user experience.
